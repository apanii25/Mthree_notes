# Project Progress - Authorization and Authentication Implementation

**Date:** March 27, 2025  
**Team Members Present:** [Add names here]  

## Achievements of the Day
1. **Authorization and Authentication Module:**
   - Successfully designed the flow for user authentication and authorization.
   - Discussed and finalized the key components for the implementation.
     - Frontend: ReactJS for building the user interface and forms.
     - Backend: SQL for managing the database and storing credentials.
   - Role-based access control for different user roles.

2. **Flow Discussion Highlights:**
   - **Frontend (ReactJS):**
     - Developed wireframes for the login and signup pages.
     - Integrated form validation for secure inputs.
   - **Backend (SQL):**
     - Designed the database schema to store user credentials and roles securely.
     - Outlined endpoints for login, signup, and token validation.
   - Implemented JWT for session management and authentication.
   - Planned middleware for role-based access to APIs.
   - Error-handling mechanisms for authentication failures.

3. **Challenges Identified:**
   - Ensuring the ReactJS frontend handles errors gracefully (e.g., invalid credentials).
   - Optimizing SQL queries for large datasets.
   - Deciding on additional security measures for SQL database protection.

4. **Next Steps:**
   - Build and test the backend APIs for authentication and authorization.
   - Develop the ReactJS components for login and signup forms.
   - Test the integration between ReactJS and the SQL backend.
   - Evaluate additional database security measures (e.g., encryption at rest, access controls).
